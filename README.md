# PROJECT MANAGEMENT

This **Bash** script was made to automate the task of creating a new project and learn Bash at the same time.<br><br>

- *be able to create a new folder* 
- *create a main function with the minimal code inside depending on the programming language asked*
- *open the new folder with Visual Studio Code*<br><br>

> ## Programming languages supported :
>- C
